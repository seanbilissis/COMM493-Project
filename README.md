LOGIN INFORMATION: 
  The Flask app will direct you to a login page. To access the dashboards:
    Username: CMO   Password: CMO
                  OR
    Username: CEO   Password: CEO  
  Each option goes to their respective dashboards. Once logged in, the navigation bar in the
  header of the page will allow you to switch between dashboards. 
  
  
RUN VENV:
  Due to many packages, I've included them into a virtual environment. The activate.bat file needs
  to be run to open the env, which can be found: env\Scripts\activate.bat
  
  Running that file in the cmd prompt should open the environment and the packages will all be installed.
  Hopefully this makes it easier to run the files. 
  

FLASK-APP: 
  The app.py file is responsible for creating the web-platform, so this is the one you'll want to 
  run to render the templates and get a URL for the page.
