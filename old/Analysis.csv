2,8,"Highly disappointed. After a single wash I found four holes in this sweater, mostly around the seams. I bought a simliar one last year and had no problems. Perhaps a decline in quality? Change in factory? ",-0.30259740259740264
3,12,"I bought this sweater  last year and it was true to size and fit the description. I take great care of my clothes, after a year the band at the waist line stretched really bad. I am disappointed in this sweater. ",-0.11168831168831168
3,16,"After washing this sweater it turned into crap, it had a course texture reminded me os sandpaper. It totally loses its shape and softness. For that price point, there are better sweaters out there - buy at your own risk ",-0.12727272727272737
3,18,"The neck is so small, not true to sweater description in the advert",-0.5909090909090908
3,20,"This is a nice dressy sweater, perfect for matching with a button down for work. However, I find the sweater leaves fluff on my coat and pretty much every where I sit. Currently trying to sort out a refund or exchange but haven't got a response. Chances of it happening are low because it's been worn :/",0.24713804713804705
4,22,"This sweater is made of some flimsy material that not only immediately shrunk after first wash, but constantly shrivels up when you wear it. Terrible purchase wish i could still return",-0.5363636363636364
4,24,"I wanted to love this sweater, it's soft, and stylish but didn't work for my body. I like that it came in pretty hot pink packaging. Not for me but I'd still recommend it though",0.4181818181818181
4,26,"Everything that could go horrible was true to this sweater. 1 star for only having seen the sweater and knowing that it exists. The color was dull, I think the pictures online are all photoshopped. It bunched up on my midriff… It  has a coton feel not wool as the description purports. I returned it in a heartbeat. ",-0.6409090909090909
4,27,"I am a minimalist without many clothes. I bought this cardigan to replace my old one. It arrived way too late for my occasion, I had to borrow my roommates sweater. When it finally arrived it had frayed seams. I had to return it. I am thoroughly disappointed. Wouldn't recommend",-0.32363636363636367
5,29,Avoid at all costs. Ordered a size larger than I normally wear. Still the sweater didn’t come close to fitting and it was awfully short.,0.22727272727272724
5,34,"the sweater does not fit very nice. One arm had a twisted seam, and the material is not good quality and is quite thin. The shoulders are very narrow so If you are going to get this you should size up. But I don't recommend you get it at all.",-0.46545454545454545
5,38," I don’t think I received a new sweater and it was also not the size I ordered. The shirts colour was very dull and there was a lot of lint balls, it’s like it’s been washed a few times already.",-0.4493112947658403
6,40,True to size Light weight sweater. Colour Looks great on me. ,0.9999999999999999
6,42,Love love love this sweater I have one in every color. I always get compliments when I wear it. I pair it with almost everything in my wardrobe. I have to return it first time I bought it because the sizes run a little small. I am a size 6 but I reordered a size 8 whcih fit perfectly. ,0.6124999999999999
6,44,Sweater is practical it’s good value but it’s missing something. I could not put my finger to it so I had to return it. I expected more for that price,0.36363636363636354
7,46,"It is a nice sweater, good quality but small for size",0.6363636363636361
7,49,"The sweater ages quickly. I was able to wear this sweater, and another in the same colour, about 5 times before it looked like an old sweater.",0.3818181818181817
7,50,"The sweater says it's 100% cotton and I believe that assertion. The small that I ordered is an 'almost small'. The sizing on these sweaters tends to run too small. I am actually a small but I fit in the medium. So if you would like to fit comfortably in the sweater that you buy, buy a size up.  If you dont do this you can try to rely on shrinking it but you will probably damage the sweater than achieve anything this way. ",-0.06493506493506496
7,56,The sweater arrived with the drawstring partially removed. I wasn't able to thread it back so I returned the item. Fabric felt nice and soft. Wish it had worked out,0.3527272727272727

8,60,Such a cute sweater for my daughter. Although she does have to wear a shirt underneath because it is a little sratchy. Perfect for nice dinners or family events .,0.7072727272727272
8,61,My daughter loves this cute sweater. It’s starting to look a bit stretched after a few wears and washes - it's not really up to normal 5-year-old play. Good for special occasions but not day-to-day. Oh well. ,0.2567717996289424
8,63,"Returned the sweater shortly after receiving it. It’s a nice heavy cable knit, perfect for winter. However, the neck is way too small. I never usually have trouble with turtlenecks but this one was too tight and constricting. I have a normal neck so I was surprised to see it was so ill-fiting. ",0.12285714285714278
8,66,I normally wear a size medium mens but ordered a small becaue it looked big. It fits well. This sweater is exactly what I wanted. It took six weeks to arrive. I never got a response about where it was so I had given up hope by the time it arrived on my door.,-0.04545454545454551
9,72,"The quality of this sweater is amazing and it came out of the laundry looking great, but I found the fit a bit small. I ordered a large and glad that I did as a medium would have been too small.  The sleeves ran a little short. It looks like they were shrunk already before I even washed it. It's a nice casual sweater that I can wear to many occasions. ",0.3139610389610389
9,74,"The sweater had several discolorations fresh out of the packaging. I called for an exchange which was processed quickly. No problems with the new one. It’s comfortable, warm, and isn't too restricting. I got the large and it fits perfectly.",0.550177095631641
9,76,I get cold - super cold. On the weekends I want to be warm and to look good. This sweater works. It is 100 % cotton and sweaters that are all cotton are hard to come by. My one complaint is that the elbows stretch when you are weatring it,-0.17662337662337668
10,79,"The sweater was not a medium as described, its sized like a medium. The fabric is really thin and you can see your undergarnments underneath. Avoid if you do not want to have to wear a shirt underneath.",-1.0
