1,Not worth the money. Color is great and fits true to size but this cardigan is really thin and not warm at all
2,"Not for me, maybe I wanted to look like the model in the picture. I ordered S, but the dress is a bit loose at the bust. I think it would be ok if I was 20 :-("
3,Told to return the dress at my cost and that I would expect refund. Month later and still dealing with their incompetence. Color was fine. Material is cheap and loose strings everywhere.
4,Material was not what I expected and dress looks different in pictures. It is more form fitting and doesn’t cover your stomach from the side making you look big.
5,"Disappointed. It's more like a polyester 1950s tunic than a dress, it's loose on top with a tight fitting skirt which I found too short (and I'm 5'2""). I'll wear this as a top/tunic but not as a dress. Probably better on someone who has a bigger bust and small hip."
6,Size chart is way off - Dress doesn't fit well. It's very short. Bottom too tight and too big. Not even worth sending back.
7,"Honestly I am kinda of speechless. I don’t even know how to write this review and sound like a credible human being, but this dress smells like medicine. Like it stinks so bad like chemical drugs I am disgusted. I am sending it back "
8,This dress feels like the same material used to make Party City Halloween costumes.... super cheap quality... not impressed
9,"Bought this dress because of all the rave reviews. I should have known buying something so cheap would look... well... cheap. It fits - but it's actually not super forgiving on the bottom. I bought a white in Large, the white was a very blue-white (not so flattering) and it really only looked ok wearing it the strapless style. Might use it as a coverup but that's it. "
10,I love the colour of this dress but the material isn't the greatest. It clings to your muffin top . I ended up wearing it like a shirt instead to give it a bit of gathering around the stomach area to hide areas I am insecure about.
11,It’s a beautiful dress it keep on wanting to ride at the back of your shoulders though and when you walk it rides up past your thighs and ends up looking like a blouse. I would not buy this again. 
12,"This dress is made of poor quality material. it is as it appears in the picture , but fits a little bigger than I thought. Should be tighter around the body. The quality of material is very cheap. I probably would not buy again."
13,"Well....lookin wonderful when you don't move! But with every single step, dress moving up till your underwear is showing lol. Definitely not for an occassion when you wanna dance and move around. Refund requested."
14,"Ordered a size larger but it still looked like I squeezed into my teenagers dress.I don't recommend this product. It's not worth the price, time and headaches that come with returns. "
15,"The fabric for this dress, was transluscent. The dress was also too short, maybe I am just too tall. I like the options you have with how you wear this dress, so.... paired it with jeans and wear it as a shirt. Super cute."
16,I ordered this dress in lime green. It fit perfectly but my only issue is that the material looks super cheap in bright lighting. Almost like barbie doll material. The material that hangs down over the front conceals your abdomen area so you don't have to tuck in your stomach.
17,"It is a fancy long t-shirt, not so much a dress. Would I get one more for my wife? Maybe if she wanted something a bit more then a t with trousers to a parent-teacher conference or something like that. It is nice that it is soft and I do like that the fuschia on the picture is the fuschia I got. Also the size I ordered was xl and that is what I got. Over all this dress looks great for a smart dress-down time."
18,"I was not gifted with height this cute white dress is a little too short, I’m 5'. The skirt rides up and you always have to pull it down. Maybe a bigger size than small would have been a better choice for me. Using the dress as a shirt  was magnificent. The material is soft and see through if you use it as a dress. "
19,"The fabric on this dress is very elastic and revealing. It was delivered faster than expected. The dress came quick, early than expected. There was lose thread in some parts of the dress straight from the packaging. I should have orderd a size smaller, my usual medium was too big."
20,"I just got this dress and couldn't wait to try it. Love the top part but the skirt is too tight, short and see-through (ordered white) for my  age  - late 40s! BUT, I tucked the skirt in & up to my bra and it serves as a great tummy controlled top outfit. I'm curious if the other colors are less see-through but regardless, I'm going to get lots of wear out of this top!"
21,The lining of the dress was dangling immediately after opening the package and I was disappointed. The dress fits perfectly just like in the pictures. The sizes were acurate and the material was thinning.  
22,I wear a small and orderd a small but it was way too tight but it was very pretty though. The photos make it seem like the material is similar to stretchy undergarment fabric. This is not at all what I was expecting. The top piece of the dress material is tinier than the picture as well. 
23,The fit for this dress was great but looked horrendous on my body. This is not the material for you if you are on the bigger side because it shows everything. The azure colour was really nice though.
24,This is a great little dress! It has tons of stretch so super comfy. The only thing is the photo shows a pencil skirt when it actually is gathered on each side of the skirt so it does rise a bit on the sides but still looks great! It's lovely that yu can adjust the height of the dress 
25,"I absolutely like the top half of this dress. However, the elastic gathering of the skirt part of the dress is a huge boooo. It makes the length too short and slides up your body when you walk. Perhaps this would have been solved by having a bigger bum. If the dress stayed put, this would have been a favorite of mine.  I will not return it, I will try to make it work with jeggings. "
26,"Amazing dress, true to description and picture. Fits perfectly well and I people always say nice stuff  when I have it on. "
27,"Good dress, very pretty shade of grey. It seems thick and will be uncomfortable in the heat. Order one size smaller!"
28,"This dress is fabulous. Is it the best made piece of clothing I've ever owned? Nope. But wow. It's flattering, forgiving, and fashionable. Superfancy material, it's way fanc than I anticipated. I was worried it would cling to my bumps but it ended up being really nice. Can be worn in several styles. Only downside is that it did not have labels for the brand or laundry steps. "
29,"ADORE the color magenta on the dress! Really unique magenta color. My complexion is snow white,  I ordered the brown too and it was a perfect fit and it seemed way lighter!  I was amazed by it. Brown seems thinner and conceals my stomach more than the magenta? I'm 6', 275, 47F. May have to return. Perhaps if I order a bigger one, it will have more material to cover my stomach. The two of them are just great!"
30,I bought this dress in purple and it was delivered it to me really fast and right on time for me to wear it to a work cocktail event! I love that it covers your tummy completely! The only bad things I can say is that it slides up so you have to wear it with pants lest you get in the business of constantly adjusting it. 
31,"Dress delivered timeously - wasn’t expecting that. You get waht you pay for; for the cheap price, the fabric was thin. The photos dont lie but order a regular if you like your clothes tight and a large for a more comfortable and relaxed look.  "
32,"This dress is fabulous. Is it the best made piece of clothing I've ever owned? Nope. But wow. It's flattering, forgiving, and fashionable. Superfancy material, it's way fanc than I anticipated.

33,Great little dress overall....a bit on the big side not humpty dumpty big though. Super stretchy and comfortable
34,"I am 5’7” and weigh 250. Oh, I am also in my late 50s and very gifted with big boobs. I bought the dress thinking if it is too short I can wear it as a shirt. I ordered the pink medium. It fits like hand and glove. Originally the length will be past the knee but the minute I start walking, it starts to ride up. The skirt bunches on the sides by design. The fabric is thicc and elastic which leaves some allowance for my big tummy. Product was delivered fast. I will wear it to a date with boyfriend, I feel sexy in it. "
35,"The dress arrived faster that the estimated delivery time. I like it, I like it, I like it !!! I am definitely goingt o get it in every color. Medium was adequate for my petite frame. "
36,"Totally love these dresses! I bought them in every colour ! In size medium. It fits true to size. I can eat as much as I want and no one can see my tummy. I can wear it as a skirt or wear it as a shirt with jeans. I can wear it as a one sleeve , or pull it up and wear it as a shirt that covers my shoulders or even pull it down and wear it as a tube top or off the shoulders. One dress that can give you many different looks! I love it !"
37,Thank you for having the plus size gals modeling in the pictures for this dress. They gave me a sense of what the dress would look like on me. It really does hide those problem areas and makes me feel great wearing it. My husband is a huge fan also. Highly recommend for women of all sizes who just want to feel sexy.
38,"I purchased the dress in black for a friends hen shindig and I have to say this dress is amazing! i'm 5 foot and i'd say like pushing 280lbs but my weight is weirdly distributed so finding clothes that look amazing is hard. but I must say this dress really covers your tummy bumps and clumps. The gathering on the side is very slimming, I feel like my old thinner self when I wear it! And if your a plus size lady in your mid 20's you know how hard it is to find clothes that aren't gonna make you look like Aunt Jane. I purchased a 4xl and it fits perfect! "
39,"I love it and the size is true to the chart provided! I wear a SP and this dress fits perfectly. The fabric is so comfortable it's like I am wear pajamas. I feel like a celebrity, my BFF approves!"
40,"Sweatpants shrunk tremendously. I am 6' 4"" 200lbs with a slightly bulky and muscular build. When I initially got these they fit good for length but weren't slim fit at all just like regular track pants but the length was great. One trip to the wash and these almost disappeared. Used to be at top of foot with a fold or two. Now they're above my ankle  and not even any more slim just short now, and I bought a large! . 55% cotton. But acts like 150%. Single stitched seems make for poor quality."
41,"Ordered one size larger for these sweatpants as they suggest and even an XL was too small ... i'm 6' and 215 lbs and these are too tight! If you have a big nether region 'tools' , it looks like it's molded in the pants ... and i don't think my mum would have let me wear those outside the house anyways !"
42,"I was pretty happy with what I bought since the size was accurate, and the quality of the fabric seems acceptable. The zipper on the sweatpants are crappy, they failed on my first workout. Repairingt he zipper will be useless as I don't know any tailors in my area. Not very good for the seller and really upsetting. "
43,These  sweatpants  crumbled very fast like feta cheese. They started to get holes in the butt area. I was too trusting and I bought 3 pairs that were all tearing withing 4 weeks. The pants were cheap and they did not last. I am a dissatisified customer. 
44,"The pants fit well. They are the best pair of  sweatpants I've ever had. They feel like butter on my legs BUT the material and how they were made is just poor taste. I had my hands in my pockets the other ay and the fabric in the pockets tore, suddenly my palms were on my thighs. I will not buy these again, the price is right the quality leaves a lot to be desired."
45,"The comfort of the pants is absolutely perfect, just too tight around the thighs and the 'package' area, maybe its because of my thunder thighs. I got an Medium but I don’t think it’s a Medium. I would not recommend these sweatpants. "
46,"Beware of the zippers on these sweatpants. They have zippers for the ankles, they worked fine for about a week then started to always get jammed. Now one of it has broken entirely and wont zip back up, so the pants are ruined. Only wore them about 10 times. But the fit and material are nice, just cheap zippers."
47,Good pair of sweatpants for yoga. they are cheap so they did not last as long as I had hoped for - cheap is not always the best. Perhaps investing in a more expensive pair would have been better.  One good thing is that they remained the same size even after washing them. 
48,These sweatpants seemed to be trusted quality. I normally wear a small and bought a medium. The medium was snug. I returned it and got an l that was perfect so order 2 sizes up! 
49,"If showing off your butt is what you are going for buy these pants. I followed the size chart to the T and even bought a size up but when I received these swetpants, they were skin tight. Save your time and money and go to a store where you can try clothes on. "
50,"Sweatpants feel like a second skin. The fabric is super soft and fluffy. The zips are not strong though, they broke after one laundry cycle. Hoping the seller will replace them when  I complain and return them "
51,"Fits well, I followed the sizing ans measurements on the charts. But the pockets on the sweatpants started ripping within a few months. "
52,There were pieces of thread all over the pants straight from the packaging and they were also slightly dirty. I am not sure if they fell on the floor while they were being packaged and the packer just continued without shaking off the dust. Length on these sweatpants is perfect. The circumference could be tighter around the ankle. 
53,"The covering at the end of the draw strings fell on these pants after wearing them once. There were flaws in the  sweatpantshere. Otherwise, I would recommend these sweats. "
54,I have gained weight and it was a struggle to find sweatpants that can still flatter my figure when I go to the gym. These pants were amazing and they were not too tight. 
55,"They fit great and look amazing. The material and the zippers on these sweatpants are average quality. But the zippers broke only after a few uses, they cant really last forever ..."
56,"Bought these for my brother for his marathon training . He says they are comfortable, but should have probably ordered medium. They are a slightly tight fit and you need a little more room for your training. other than that they are great workout sweatpants that also wash well. I hang them out to dry on the clothes line to prevent shrinkage. "
57,"Really liked the price, and the quality of fabric but I'm 6' 4"", 185lbs and took size large. They just looked like big oversized pyjama pants and were too long. I returned them and ordered a size medium, I am happy with my new pair of sweatpants. "
58,"I am really happy i ordered these sweatpants, when I received them they were longer but now they grew shorter from shrinkage.. I am 6’2 and when i got them they were slightly below my ankle and they are above my ankle. They are very comfy and a simple pair of running pants or loungewear."
59,Grime-esque sweatpants. Wanna look like Stormzy? Well these are the perfect Stormzy pants that you can Vossi Bop in.  Good for the streets
60,"I'm a heavy set man and I like wearing clothes that leave a little wiggle room. When I first put these sweatpants on I thought they were too large, but after washing them, they yshrunk to my perfect size. If they had not shrunk I would have returned them. They are fluffy and the material is a perfect fit, I mostly like the length. Fabric is all great quality. "
61,"I am a bulky man from muscle that I have gained from my extreme working out. Size XL for these sweatpants fit me well, not snug but the right kind of sexy loose. The material allows air circulation and allows me to cool down at the gym. I would repurchase these pants. "
62,I bought these sweatpants for my boyfriend. His touche is adorable in them. My boyfriend cannot stop bragging about how comfortable they are.
63,These sweatpants  have a fitted look to them. The man area had adequate length and my 'boys' were not squashed in the pants. You cannot beat the price on these pants. I am also using them as lounge wear. The colors have not faded yet after many laundry cycles. 
64,"These pants fit well, and the material quality makes them feel more comfortable than any other pair I have owned. A small gripe is the slight fraying at the bottom of the pants -- I wish they were more tapered for a more streamlined look. Overall, I would recommend the pants to anyone looking for a gym or even casual everyday sweatpants. They are so comfortable."
65,I got these in excellent time and was very impressed with them. They look great and I got many compliments on them. After a few days I noticed a crack on the brim by the nose piece. I didn’t think much of it until it got bigger and then broke off a part of the sunglasses. Now instead of looking expensive they look like garbage. I don’t know if they came cracked or if they just crack easily but I did not enjoy them.
66,"Unfortunately, you get what you pay for. Cheap deal gives you cheap sunglasses that fall apart straight from their packaging. Some parts of the sunglasses were missing but I noticed they had fallen into the box I salvaged them and my boyfriend fixed them but he fixes did not last a week. The seller refused to accept them for returns. Stay away from this horror story. "
67,The sunglasses sit crooked on the face. I never thought I would have used crooked and sunglasses in the same sentence but here we are. Will not purchase these ever again. 
68,"After only one day with these sunglasses, I noticed that the two lense had different colors. This is ridiculous. These guys should consider selling pirate eye patches, that were they are headed at this rate. Stay away from their glasses.  "
69,No ultraviolet protection for these  sunglasses  as the description claims. They used deceipt to get us to buy the glasses. They are not getting a repeat purchase from me. 
70,The ear pads that are supposed to protect your ear hurt my childs ear with these  sunglasses. I am disappointed. They woudnlt accept returns and the ear pad is not an easy fix. Money down the drain. 
71,"These sunglasses were a good buy for a cheap add on to my christmas stockings, however they are horribly made, I was embarrased when my nephew opened them on Christmas day and they fell apart from the packaging . "
72,"Great pair of sunglasses for a good price except for the part where my husband received them and brand new from the box, they looked like they had been worn for 5 years already with scratches and all. Easy and cheap doesn’t do it. "
73,"After wearing them for only 3 times, they cracked maybe its because of how my head is broader than the average human head.  The packaging was not that durable for a pair of sunglasses and I wish they came with a case. "
74,"I never thought I would say, 'I have found the one!' for sunglasse but I think this is the one pair that makes me look trendy and chic. They sit on my face well and frame my features perfectly. They are a good pair of quality glasses "
75,Absolutely perfect sunglasses for small faces. I got this pair when I lost my old pair. Everyone asks me about them. They were a good buy. I even had them fitted for my prescriptions.  
76,"Sunglasses were true to their description. They really protect my eyes from the sun. They are a great fit, I have even gone biking with them and they protected my eyes from the wind and never fell from my face.  "
77,"We sail a lot and we were looking for a great pair of sunglasses that we could wear even when we switched to jetskiing. My oh my, this pair was made for the water. I got one for everyone in my family and we all love them. "
78,"I bought these sunglasses for my winter trip with my wife to Florida. We knew we were going to be exposed to the sun for many months. They arrived in time for our trip. We wore them every day for the 6 months that we were in Florida. They are durable, we didn’t expect to have them for this long. "
79,The only negative thing that I would say about the sunglasses is that they are too dark than what the picture shows. However this is not to say that it's a bad thing. I actually like darker sunglasses. I wore them to my son's baseball game for the first time on a windy day and they very well served their purpose
80,"I like that the sunglasses come with two options for cases - the hard case and the soft case with padding and a drawstring at the top. The price is also right. For the quality of the sunglasses, I can afford to have one pair in the car and one pair in my handbag all the time.  "
81,"Trendy sunglasses that do not make you look cheap at all. I was tired of seeing poor quality sunglasses that have shimmer on all the wrong places and just looked cheap. I am very happy with my affordable purchase. If this pair lasts long with no issues for a few months, I will go back and buy another pair "
82,The first pair of sunglasses that I bought arrived all damaged from the box. I returned it and told the seller of the damage. The seller was quick to respond. I received a refund on the first pair and they sent a good pair for free. Now that's what I call integrity. I will be doing business with them again. I have no issues with the replacement pair and they fit perfectly!
83,Its always a struggle to find sunglasses that wrap around my face well. When these sunglasses where delivered I immediately fell in love with the way they framed my face. They are also a very affordable pair that did not break my bank
84,Excellent fit. Excellent tint. These sunglasses are the GOAT! Everyone needs to have a pair  
85,"Sunglasses are a great fit for my narrow face. They are also lightweight. It doe not feel like you have glasses on at all. I have had my pair for more than 2 years now. Sunglasses usually last a season only for me, this pair has stood the test of time I strongly recommend it! "
86,These boots let in water within 1 monthof buying them. I was first drawn to them because of the cute picture on the website but they did not live up to what the description said. I am highly disappointed
87,I think these boots were made for a Florida or Texas winter. They are not warm at all for a real Canadian winter. The temperature ratings on the website are all a lie. I would not wish even my worst enemy to buy this boot. 
88,The website says the boots are for women with wide calves. I have very wide calves and I thought I had finally found a winter boot that I would look cute in without forcing in on my legs. I was very disappointed when I received these boots. First they were not delivered on time then I could not fit my calves in them because they hava a tight zipper on the side. I returned them immediately 
89,I can's even imagine if the company that made these boots has a quality assurance team. The boots insoles were sloped such that your foot slides to the front of the boot. This meant that my toes would always be jammed to the front of the boot. It was the most painful pair of shoes I ever owned. I wish I had realised this design flow before i wore them outside and returned them. I only came to the realization after wearing them a few times. HIghly disappointed eh! 
90,The outside of the boots looks cute but he inside leaves a lot to be desired. It's one of those things  that the pictures online do not not capture and the description can never tell. You will only get to find out after you have worn the boot for some time. My niece and i bought matching pairs but we could not return them so now we are stuck with 2 pairs of boots we barely wore. What a waste of money.  
91,"The fur inside these boots was not as soft as the description made it out to be. For the price of these boots, I would choose a more durable brand. I happily returned this pair for my money back, what an inconvenience. I will continue to shop for a better boot. "
92,"Sizes for these boots run pretty high. I bought my ususal size 6 and when I received them, my leg slid right in and left so much room, I could not cover it up with socks. Also they delivered different lengths for the boots - one was ankle height, the other was slightly taller. I am returning them. "
93,Not a perfect fit for my wide feet. The boots sizes are captioned as 9w in the descritpion but this was not true. They are so narrow that they hurt my feet. I only realized after I wore them in the snow to a party. This means I cannot return them anymore because of the salt lines they now have. Such marketing deception. I will buy anything from them again 
94,"When I took these boots from the box, these was a spot inside one of them where the padding was clumped up. I think it’s glue build up. This pair should not have been sold or maybe should have been sold at a discount. Also the other boots lace was way short, it was not enough to tie them up.I am not pleased with these boots, they are going back"
95,"I need my shoes in half sizes. The pictures of these boots looked amazing on the website and I decided to try them out in a full size up. Even though they are comfortable, I wish they were made in half sizes. I will be returning the pair and writing to the manufacturer"
96,"These boots hurt my feet at the back. They rubbed up against my ankle until I started bleeding. Even after putting a bandaid, they still hurt. This was only after wearing them for one day. It meant that with the blood stains I could not return them. It's frustrating because they are my right size. I guess the sizes run lower. Stay away from these, dont let the pictrure and description fool you."
97,I liked the colour of these boots  from seeing the pictures on the website. I was utterly disappointed though when I received them. I realised the gray was ashy and I could not pair the boots with a lot of my pieces in the wardrobe. I returned them for having a color scheme that does not exist on the color spectrum. 
98,The manufacturers have changed a lot on this boot. It used to be so comfortable. Felt like I was walking on some fluffy candy floss with my old pair but this new pair I got is so thin. They are maintaining the price and compromising on quality to make profits. 
99,"I wouldn't write home about these boots. The inside material started to wear off after 3 months. I would say that would be normal wear and tear for any type of shoe but for the price tag on these boots, I expected a little more durability "
100,"Classis boots, I have had this pair since last season. They are comfortable and toasty. I had to return a pair that initially came in the mail when I bpiught them last year because they sent me the wrong color. Other than that mishap, I do not have anything negative to say about the boots "
101,I returned these boots. The look lighweight on the pictures and the descriptions does not list any heavy material that was used to make them but to my surprise they were a heavy pair that I could not lug on my tiny feet
102,These cute little boots are only cute in the picture. They were delivered right on time but when I tried to put them on it was a nightmare. I had to sit down and wiggle just to wear boots. The ankle is just too tall - they were desperately in need of a zipper on the side. I sent them back
103,"Looked like work boots in real life. I could not stand their look when they were delivered. I am into goth clothing but this was just too industrial looking for me. The price was right but not my style. Off to the seller, they just had to be returned"
104,I have owned a pair of similar boots before. This was a repurchase because I was impressed with the first pair. I can’t say the same for this one. It is too stiff on my foot which is one of those things you don't realise right after you unbox or after a few 'wears'. I am still going to wear them out because I dont believe in waste and not using things to the max but I am disappointed. I will be looking elsewhere for my next pair of boots 
105,"When I received these boots in the mail, they had a broken seam close to the zipper. I returned them and received a better pair. The pair that was not damaged did not last though. It fell apart on the zipper seams after I wore it for one winter season. The first broken zipper seams should have been a cue for me to get my money back instead of another pair of boots"
106,Delivery was a nightmare for these boots. I ordered them because I had a snowshoeing trip lined up in 2 weeks. The delivery promise was 1 week from time of order. I ended up leaving for my trip without receiving the boots. I had to borrow my cousin's boots. I am now enjoying the pair but the delivery sucks 
107,No grip on these boots . I almost fell 5X the first time I wore them to work. I didn't want to buy a pair of yak traks on top of purchasing expensive boots which were touted as having tractor grip. I 'm disappointed. Shoes need not have renovations done on them
108,Even my thick socks could not save these saggy boots. They are not true to normal sizes. I wear a size 13 and I always look for comfort in my shoes. Did not find either comfort or fit in these shoes and I sent them packing 
109,My feet swole after I wore these twice. For the price of these boots I expected nothing short of perfection. I guess they are right when they say if you want perfect go to heaven. Tehse boots sent me right to hell. I couldn't return them so I sold them to our local consignment store
110,"When you need a party of army men to help you get into a shoe, you know it's badly flawed. I tried many ways to put these boots on painlessly after I received them but the whole process brought tears and it was the hardest try-on I have ever done In my life. The price is right, the design is severy flawed. More stretch material on the sides may have salvaged this boot's reputation. Boots have been returned"
111,"I loved the rubber sole on these boots . But the fit was too tight. Think of a very tight embrace from your granny, that what this boot did to my feet. Now I like my grandmothers embraces, only from her and only a few times a year. A shoe should be comfortable. I returned these shoes only because of the snug fit "
112,"I am a sucker for cute packaging. When I read another customer's review which included the gold box that these boots come in, I was instantly sold. The description of the boots was also not that bad. BUT after I wore then a couple of time the leather started to peel off. I went back to read the description only to see that they are made of pineapple leather. What in the world is pineapple leather???? "
113,"My mother wore boots from this seller in her teens and they stood the test of time then. I think they are now crumbling to the time test now. I bought a pair two months ago and I wore them on my 3 week trip to Europe, the soles are already starting to give in. Maybe I abused them a little but I expected more from this brand at that price than only a 3-week lifespan "
114,The boots formula changed. I owned a pair sometime back and they were then discontinued. When I saw them back on the website I was excited and I bought the exact same size I had bought before but this time there were delays in delivery and the boots looked cheap straight from the packaging. I wore them anyway but I should have known better and returned them - not the same boot anymore :-( 
115,"Waiting for the boots until kingdom come was not fun. I paid a huge price for them, all I was asking for was 1 week delivery as promised in the  description "
116,"Cute boots in the picture, not as cute when you see them face-to-face. I guess the camera lies. I sent them packing "
117,"Unfortunately I will return these boost. I think they have too many unnecessary zippers on the sides that take away from the bourgie look I was going for. With all the shiny zippers, they really look cheap. "
118,Amazing boots for the cold weather. They don’t do well in slushy snow though so only wear them when it's cold and dry because they are warm and comfortable 
119,"They are slightly different boots from the pair that I bought from the same selller last year but I still love them. It looks like I struck gold, I havent been disappointed by any of the shoe purchases I have made from this seller and the price is affordable . "
120,"I bought these boots as a gift for my daughters graduation. They arrived just in time for the big day. My daughter loves them, she has ignored all the other boots in her closet for this pair"
121,"Color looks great with most of my pants, dresses and skirts. I have struggled in the past to get an all rounder boots that I can match with most of the clothes in my wardrobe. This comfortable, cozy and warm boot checks all the boxes that I have been looking for in a winter boot.  I approve! "
122,"I would buy these boots over and over and over again. You can tell that a lot of thought was put into making these shoes strong and durable while attractive and stylish at the same - a hard combo to achieve for winter boots. I donl't mind that they are a little pricy, I like to pay for good quality  "
123,I thought these boots were waterproof from the description but they are not. I resolved that problem by buying one of those waterproof sprays for boots from my local shoe shop and voila!!! Problem solved. I now have an all weather pair of cute boots that do not let water in 
124,"I adore them, I bought a pair in brown and they were so comfortabe and cute that I went back to buy the black pair. I have never received as many cmpliments on boots as I have with these pairs. They are a geat quality and a total head-turner "
125,"The pair I got is a little tight on the calves but that's how I always buy my boots. They will get wider with time. They are my perfect size and they were deliverd earlier than I expected and I went to work looking really cute, also earlier than I expected. Must have for a every woman's wardrobe!  "
126,Very comfortable pair of boots that I would recommend for anyone who is looking for a boot that is versatile and can be worn at the office and casual occasions 
127,"Called in to ask about returning the boots for a slightly bigger size. The reperesentative I talked to was super helpful. I was able to return the boots and get my right size in less than 2 weeks. Because of the great customer service and the reasonable prices, I will be shopping for other clothing items form this seller"
128,"Why are you doubting yourself, you should buy these boots already! They are soft and fluffy and the sizing is perfect. You don’t have to think twice about this purchase, they are a great value for your hard earned cash. I have a pair in every color "
129,Yeh! I am still the greatest gift giver I bought these for my aunt who loves loves loves loves them! She has told me many times that she has referred her friends to this website for the boots. Now quality speaks for itself and I think this boot is selling itself because of its durability and stylish look - no need to market these
130,The best pair of boots that my husband has ever bought for me. He has a great eye for good quality and his instincts dod not fail us this time. 
131,"Wearing these and walking aound in them feels like I am floating on a cloud. I have never gotten this great feeling from a pair of boots before. They were a great purchase, I will keep them well to get the most out of them because they were not really cheap "
132,The stopper on one the laces broke off the second time I wore these boots. It's pretty hard to wear them without laces. I will phone the seller to see if they can send me a new pair of shoelaces 
133,Sitill waiting for money after I returned the boots. They were not the right ordinary size and they were not industrial boots that I could wear to work as I had hoped. 
134,Cheaply made boots . They are really not worth the price tag. Do not buy 
135,The top crumbled after wearing them for only one week. I have a comparable pair of boots that I have had for the past 4 years and it still looks great. 
136,"I called in to return this pair of boots as they did not fit my niece I had bought a gift for, I was told to return the pair and buy a new pair as there would be no exchanges, I did exactly that and the new pair came with its own fit flaws. Just becasue of the return/exchange policy, I am now stuck with 2 pairs of boots i dont need and there is no response to my inquiries from the seller via email or phone"
137,The sole on these boots fell apart in less than a week. The description talks about how durable they are but this was not true in our case. I have already worn them and I don't know what to do with a sole that now depicts a tongue. 
138,"I received a pair of defective boots. I emailed the seller pictures of the defects but simply because I had worn them outside and had missed the defects when I examined them out of the package, the seller was adamant about accepting the boots as returns to give me back my hard earned money. I am never buying anything from this seller again "
139,Sister sent these boots back because they wore out faster than what is promised on the description. Seller denied our flaw claim saying I had damaged them from wear and I tear. Wear and tear from only one week - unbelievable! 
140,"$300 thrown down the drain for these boots. I cant even imagine the number of boxes the boot did not tick right from taking out of the package. The color is not light blue, rather it’s some shade of gray. The shoe laces were shorter than what the picture shows and the quality was questionable "
141,Not good for my custodian work - I was looking for a strong boots that can let me climb ladders and get into nooks and crannies without thinking twice about what I step on. This boot failed dismally. The sole if so soft even a small thorn can prickle it. Imagine what harm industrial nails could do to it 
142,"Ordinarily, I like the brand these boots come from but  have to pass on this pair as it did not live up to the quality I expected from the brand. I sent the pair I bought back before I wore it "
143,"Way bigger than the normal sizes that I am used to buying for boots. I don’t know what happened to the size for these boots but they were just too big. I did not return them though, I gifted them to my cousin who wears a size bigger than I do and he likes them"
144,I ordered the boots online and they were too small. Our store accepts in store returns so I did that and I got the right size. It was great to try the shoes in store and get the proper size and fit. Get these shoes just don’t' order onlie to avoid the return hassle.  
145,The inside flap of these boots dug into my ankles. Everything else was perfect. Great size even for my wide feet. Timely delivery. The price was a bit steep for me but I was willing to pay for quality. Unfortunately I had to return them because they hurt my ankle - luckily I test run my shoes for days in the house. 
146,"The box for these boots was an eyesore when I received them. I bought them as a gift for my cousin for his birthday. I had to go through the trouble of buying a better box to put the boots in, in time for Christmas. "
147,I have had many pairs of boots from this seller in the past and they have all been amazing quality. I don't know what happened with this brand and pair. It was not comfortable. I think the inner padding was not as warm as the description said. I had to buy a new pair of insoles. 
148,These boots were perfect for the rainy weather that I was exposed to everyday at the new place that I moved to. I wore them mostly casually or on my walk to work and they did a great job protecting my feet from the rain. An unexpected bonus was the comfort
149,"A baptism gift that I am still being thanked for! My grandson really loved these boots. I bought them in white to match his cute little outfit. It's been 3 years since his baptism and he still wears them, he might be outgrowingthem soon though  "
150,"I lift a lot of boxes for my work. These boots are great because when I have dropped boxes on my feet, they haven't hurt me. Sometimes I clean and mop water for my job and I havent had my feet wet because these boots are great"
151,The quality of these boots is just amazing. I bought a pair five years ago and I only got rid of that pair because it was worn out. I bought another pair last month and I still swear by the quality of these shoes. They are definitely a great value for money and the seller has exceptional customer service 
152,The price point for these boots is pretty high. I put in a lot of hours in my job this year so I decided to spoil myself with these shoes. I do not regret my decision. The colour is good and they are comfortable and warm. I only have good things to say. 
153,The packaging left a lot to be desired but the boots are made strong and they have seen me through 3 winters
154,I like these boots. They arrived on time when I ordered them in a box that was not labelled which I also liked because I don’t like to tell the world about my purchases. I wish they could make the boot lining in another colour not off white. It's hard to keep clean 
155,Durable and nice looking boots. They definitely serve their purpose and I would buy again 
156,Bought a pair for work that has kept really well over the years. I had to go back and buy another pair of these boots to use everyday when I am not at work. I got lucky they were discounted at that time
157,Very soft on the inside and rough and tough on the outside. What a stylish pair of boots that every man needs to have in his wardrobe 
158,"One can really never have enough of a good thing - same goes for these boots tbh, if they were not expensive I would buy a pair in every colour but I do get that quality has to be slightly pricy"
159,I am a mentor for Big Brother Big Sister. I asked my little brother what he would like for Christmas and he mentioned these boots I had never heard of them before. When they arrived I was having dinner at mine with my family and little brother. He tried them on and they fit like a hand in a glove. He loved the color. I will be buying a pair for my son too 
160,Color is great. Boots are comfortable. Price is right 
161,I can't resist wearing these boots everyday. It's like they call my name every morning. I have other shoes in my closet but since these boots arrived 2 months ago I just can't let them go. They are true to size and the description matches them to a T
162,Solid boots. I have had a pair since my early 20s. This is my third purchase since I bought that first pair and I am still in love. They have lasted on average 5 years which is very very long in the shoe world 
163,I had issues with a bit of scuff marks when the boots were delivered to me. I Called customer care and I must say I have never had such exceptional service. They directed me on how to make returns and I received the replacement in pair just in time for my event.  I highly recommend 
164,"It's not just buying boots with this pair. It's a whole experience. Great price, color, quality, delivery, packaging - nothing bad to say "
165,Every man needs a pair of these boots. They serve a double purpose. I slide right from work to the bar with these boots. The price is on the high end but I pay because I buy one pair for two purposes. 
166,Versatile boots that I can pair with anything in my wardrobe! I have them in tan and I have no regrets buying
167,"Bought these boots for my boyfriend when we were invited for a Haloween party. My boyfriend wanted to dress as Sheriff Woody from Toy Story. The boots completed his look. Even though I only bought them for Haloween, he has used them for many other casual outings. I apporove of these boots "
168,"Very pleased with my purchase of these boots for my son. He wears them for school, work and when he goes out with his friends. He has worn them a lot, I might need to buy a new pair soon but they have really lasted long "
169,Strong and comfortable ususally don’t go in one sentence but I have to use them both for these boots. They look great and they are also tough. I bought a black pair because I did not want to deal with the bruising especially when you use public transport and walk a lot like I do 
170,"The picture for this blouse was cute and the blouse looked flattering on the model, just not on me. I wish they could have detailed descriptions on fit for oversized girls "
171,"Contrary to the description online, it was not easy at all to take care of this blouse. I should have been wiser and bought black not white.I am disappointed by the mismatch in description and reality"
172,The blouse was stained when I received. I was so disappointed. I hae to return it  Even the delivery was not on time to begin with I had to wait two more weeks from the promised. I had almost forgotten about it 
173,Material on this blouse is too dense. You will get toast in the blouse. That is not what I was going for. It's really hard to tell these things from the description or the pictures. I sent it to my local donation box 
174,Beware of scam advertising. Nothing on the description fit the shirt. It was way too small when I received it even though I normally fit a medium I think their medium is XS. I mean not all of us a stick thin. Buy a better blouse from another seller or go in store to avoind the same disappointment I suffered
175,"I wish sellers could take time to present their clothing items well. I get that shipping shakes things in their packaging but if something is wrapped well to begin with, it will survive the shipping scuffle. The blouse arrived late and it was too creased, looked like a donkey had chewed it.. like seriously OMG. I was put off, I had to return it.  "
176,I tried the blouse on after it arrived. Lifted my arms and it ripped. I called to ask about return and they could not take it back because I tore it. What crappy adverstising and customer service. 
177,Its not silk!!! They lied... The description said the blouse was silk but it's not. I am highly disappointed. I never really wear cotton. What will I do with this old people's apparel? 
178,The material on this blouse is coarse. I have used a wire brush with my dad in his wood shop - that's how I would describe this piece of bad blouse. I am returning it. I don't care how much it costs
179,Blouse wont cover your midriff if you are chubby like me. I like my clothes to be decent and I am past the age where I flaunted my tummy. Check and read the blouse length description before you buy. I was disappointed but I now wear it with a camisole 
180,"Returned this blouse. Colour was amazimg but my right size, M, ran a little small "
181,"Despite taking great care of this blouse, washing in cold water, on a gentle cycle and hanging outside to dry, this blouse shrank on me. I have assigned it the clothes-to-dye-my-hair-with pile. It wore out after one wash "
182,"Unfortunately, i have to return this blouse. I don’t know if I was just unlucky. My friends bought the same blouse and they recommended it. I see them wearing it and it looks good on them. I had a bad experience though. Bad size that could not fit and very late delivery with sub par packaging  "
183,The blouse is made for people who have wide chests and small arms. I am not sure who is built like that. I bought my right size and it was like what I just described. Returned it to get a different size and this time it was tight on the bust and had loose sleeves. I returned the second time for my money. Look elsewhere.
184,"This was not a flattering purchase. I decided to look past that and still wear the blouse hoping it would grow on me. No, it was a mistake. I feel self conscious about how bad looking the blouse is on me. I just wear it in the house now.Only buy if you are looking for loungewear with bad fit. "
185,"The boxes with the blouse arrived when I was on a 2 week vacation in Europe. I was so tired when I got back I did not open the boxes immediately. Now I have opened the package, the blouse has stains on it. I really did not expect this and I am disappointed because we are past the return time. Why should returns have an end date. What a waste "
186,"I am particular about what I wear and I care about the environment. The description for this blouse says it is made from bamboo extracts but I highly doubt that. I think this was made with cotton. I could tell immediately after I took the blouse out of its packaging, I cannot support companies that do not care for the environment so I returned it "
187,"I washed this blouse before I tried it on because I have allergies. After I tried it, I could not stop scratching because I was itching everywhere. I don’t know what it is but it was not for me or anyone else. I usually donate unwanted clothing but with this, I had to throw it out "
188,Tried the blouse on and the material felt cheap. It reminded me of the scrubs that I see healthcare workers wearing. I would have paid more for a better quality. 
189,"If you order a variety of colors, they come slightly different made for this blouse. I loved my black and red. The white and blue were a bad fit. I wonder why and how fit can range by color. I actually don't know what to recommend except good luck … maybe"
190,Nothing to write home about with this blouse. Its just a plain good ol' blouse that serves it's purpose. You can't really expect that much for the low price tag 
191,You need to wash this blouse maybe 15 times before the material is soft and comfortable. It comes in stiff material that doesn’t feel as flowy as it looks on the picture 
192,"This blouse did not fit me well despite ordering my rigt size, medium. It ran too small. I decided not to return it. I am wearing it with all the fromt buttons open and it it cute that way with jeans "
193,"I'm not happy. The blouse fit perfectly when I received it. However, after the first laundry round it shrank really bad and I could not get the creases however hard I tried to iron it "
194,The white for this blouse is not pure white. I didn't notice that from the picture 
195,"Needed a blouse for work but I guess I can never look cute at work.. It is functinal in that it is a white shirt but I don't like how it sits on my chest and arms. If I didn’t need it for work, I would have returned it and bought something with a better fit"
196,"Do you have an iron? If not, don't buy this blouse. It wrinkles up so much after every wash. I really don't have time to iron my landry. Other than that, it was a good buy"
197,Something about the high collar on this blouse that irks me. I don't like that it rides on my neck and I have to continuosly rub my neck. Maybe they can change the design and make it without the collar
198,"Packaging for this blouse was damaged when it was delivered. Because of the damaged packaging, I don’t know how the shirt got torn in the process. I opened it, saw the damage and immediately sent it back because even after trying the damaged one, I didn't like it"
199,Good blouse. Arrived on time. But the XXL looks like a L. Will be returning 
200,I bought this blouse in arctic white. It is the perfect color for my work The S seems a bit bigger than a normal small that I fit into but that is ok because I will wear it for work where I need to be decent 
201,I really like the design of the blouse with the hidden buttons. It makes for a stylish look… I mean it wouldn't have changed the function of the blouse but it adds a lille elegance. I got it in the classic red and I love it 
202,"It has been a struggle to find white blouses for work. I work in a bakery. This blouse ticked all the boxes I was looking for - fit, quality, length of sleeves and material that breathes "
203,Versatile blouse which was gifted to me by my sister. I then decided to buy two more in purple and green. I really like the way they fit and how I can wear the blouses for work and for casual events 
204,"My jeans, slacks, skirts and every other bottom in my wardrobe loves this blouse. So do I! The material is so soft and comfortable and the price is right "
205,Looks like this blouse was made for my wife. I like how it fits her well and how brown accentuates her eye color. I bought it last years for her birthday and she is still thanking me for it
206,The blouse fit its description and picture to a T. I am happy with my purchase 
207,Perfect blouse for work and for a good price. I will order more colors 
208,"If you want to make a statement at work, order this blouse. Everyone in my office complimented me and I got a boost of confidence. I went back and ordered 6 more colours "
209,This is like the little black dress that every woman should have. All women also need to have this blouse in white. It fits work and non-work activities. I recommend it. I would advise that you buy a size up though as it runs small
210,This blouse fit me like it was made only for me. I liked the color and the fit around my tummy looked exactly like the model in the picture. I recommend the blouse! 
211,I can wear the blouse buttoned up for work or unbuttoned with a tank top underneath for casual events. I like its versatility. It arrived right on time in cute pink packaging that I have repurposed to put my earrings
212,I have never worn a blouse that is so soft and cozy. I like the material. The length of the blouse is a bit too short so one may not be able to wear it with leggings. But other than that everything else about the blouse was perfect
213,I have now bought two of these blouses. The first one far exceeded my expectations and I just had to buy another one. It fit me perfectly and I am happy that none of my body parts are exposed. I can also move freely while wearing it and I still remain decent. I appreciate the seller for accommodating mature women like me who are past the age of exposing their bodies to the world
214,I never do repeat purchases because I am a minimalist - one of anything is enough for me. I had to make an exception for this blouse. When I bought it online it arrived on time in a beautiful box that I really did not want to thrw out. I was more amazed when I opened the packaging and tried on the blouse. It is such a flattering fit that accentuates all my best feature. I went back to buy a second one and right now I am tinkering with the idea of buying a third one for a friend
215,Love this blouse. Excellent quality at an affordable price. Every woman should buy one for herself 
216,"I bought this blouse for myself but my boyfriend steals it from me from time to time. If there is a test that a product is amazing, this should be it. I like that it can fit both men and women. I am definitely going to buy another one for myself and one for my boyfriend. It is a well made comfortable blouse"
217,My work requires me to dress to the nines. I bought these blouses for work. I get a lot of compliments every time I wear them to work. Other ladies in my department have asked me where I bought it and I have shared your website. They have been pleasantly surprised by the low price for such a great quality blouse
218,"The picture did not even do justice to how this blouse looks, feels and fits in real person. I have had delivery delays with other sellers but this blouse arrived well before the estimated delivery time. When I tried it, my children only had good things to say - they are usually brutally honest when something does not look good. "
219,"No need to delay your decision or save this blouse in your cart. Go ahead and buy it, you will not regret your decision. I loved that it is available in may colours. I ordered one in white and it was the brightest white that I have ever seen. The packaging was clean and the blouse did not have any stains on it. The blouse fits well and is very versatile. I am going to buy more colours for myself and for my friends too"
220,Washed this shirt once and it shrunk really bad. I don’t think my 7 year old can even fit into it now. I really followed the instructions. 
221,"Shirt was wrong size. I called the seller to return it and I was told to wait because I would receive return pacakging. 5 months later, I am still waiting for promised return packaging "
222,I usually wear a medium but this sellers medium shirts are way too small. I could not tuck it in when I received it and I immediately returned it 
223,Material for this shirt was way too shiny in person than what it looks like on the picture. The material also felt really cheap
224,The color of this shirt bled out with my first wash. I was really expecting a whole lot for the hefty price I paid. If I wanted poor quality I would have gone to Walmart - not buying again 
225,"No way I am wearing this bad shirt to my brother's wedding. I went by other good reviews for this shirt but I should have listened to the nay sayers. It is not well made, I could have returned it but I didn’t want the hustle  "
226,How can one sleeve on one shirt be longer than the other? These are some of the design flaws that you can never pick up from the description or pictures but I was disappointed when I found out. I returned the shirt
227,The collar on this shirt sat too high on my neck. I could not without the shirt rubbing on me. I thought I was going to tough it out and still wear it but I have given up. 
228,"I don’t think they can make this shirt right for bigger men like me. I wear medium, the first one I ordered had small sleeves. I returned it for a large, which was still small. I would say buy 3 sizes up  "
229,The Shirt had stains when I received it but I did not see them because they were oil-like stains on grey. I was very embarassed when one of my co-workers pointed this out at work. I am disappointed. 
230,Runs a little small. I could not raise my hands above my head wearing this shirt and also it came untucked multiple times. I had worn it 3 times when I then discovered all these problems and I could not return it
231,I received a wrong order when I bought this shirt. I then called the seller to ask for an exchange. I talked to a bunch of rude people. I sent the package back and I only received my refund months later 
232,"This shirt was a gift for my boyfriends birthday. The description says the seller can gift-wrap items. I went with that option. When my boyfriend was unwrapping the shirt on his birthday, it had stains on it. Looked like someone had cleaned the yard with it. We managed to exchange it for a cleaner one "
233,"For the price I paid, I expected this shirt to be out of this world. No, it's just your regular shirt that actually borders on being too cheap. It's way too shiny, I don't like it "
234,"It's not the greatest shirt I have ever owned and it's also not the worst shirt I have ever owned. It's the best of the midrange class like a Toyota. I think I will haveit for a long time but I would not dress up to work with it, I will probably wear it to braai parties "
235,The inside seams were not sewn to close them from scratching your skin. I expected a lot from the shirt but it left seam marks on me. I now wear it with undershirts 
236,Initially the shirt did not stay tucked. I then bought and added a new button at the bottom and it now stays tucked. I moved from loathing it to 'I can live with this'
237,Its great! Color does not run out after washing this shirt and size stays the same. The only negative thing I have to say is that there were threads near the buttons that were sticking out. I just cut them  
238,The shirt was slightly small for a XXL. On time delivery and great packaging 
239,Soft and cozy shirt for a reasonable price 
240,The camera lied for this shirt. It fit perfectly well on the model. I lok exactly like the model they have and my measurements are the same but I was disappointed when I received it because it’s a tad small
241,"The shirt has some details that are poorly sewn for example, I don’t think that it was intentional for the front pocket to be sewn shut. These are irrelevant details on an otherwise decent shirt "
242,It's a comfortable shirt that I can wear to work and to social gatherings as smart casual. 
243,Great fit for my boyfriend!!! The shirt accentuates his broad shoulders which I love :-) 
244,"Feels like I had this shirt custom made for me by a personal tailor but no, it's just a well made garment. I like it  "
245,My ties sat on the shirt collar very well. I even tried my bowties on it and they looked great. Not many shirts can accommodate the classic bowtie nowadays. This one wonderfully surprised me 
246,You can buy several of these shirts and get a reduced price. That would be a bet if you don't know how they will fit or their quality but I bought them using the deal and I got value for money for buying the package with 3. I recommend it! 
247,On time delivery for the shirt that I needed for my father's funeral is what I needed and the seller exceeded that expectation with earlier than estimated delivery on this great shirt. 
248,Decent shirt that I will wear to work. I will probably go back to buy some more because they are required in white at my job. 
249,Shirt looks good with my jeans and almost all other pants that I have in my wardrobe and it's good quality. I am ordering another one today 
250,"I don’t know if I will be able to remove the delivery wrinkles from this shirt . I called customer services and they were really nice, they gave me the idea of steaming the shirt and it came out looking cute "
251,Great fit and quality for this shirt but you need to iron it
252,This shirt seems like it is aeriated. I wore it a party where I was dancing all night and I did not smell bad the entire time. The material is great quality and it’s a comfortable fit 
253,"I really don’t care about clothes compliments that much but with this shirt they have just been off the charts. I don't normally write reviews either but I think this shirt deserves my five stars, I will be ordering more in other colors "
254,The over the phone customer service was excellent in answering my shirt questions before I made the purchase. This solidifed my decision to buy the shirt. It fit really well and was delivered on time 
255,"Thank you for making the perfect shirt for tall and slim men like me. Whenever I buy shirts, they are always too short but this one deals with the height issue really well. The price is also right "
256,"The buttons and button holes on the shirt I originally ordered were mismatched. This was definitely a mistake. I contacted the seller by phone, they apologized profusely asked me to ship back the shirt. I received the replacement shirt in no time at all"
257,My dad loves this shirt that I bought him for Father's day. It was a surprise so I raided his wardrobe to look for his shirt size from the other shirts he owns. He wears a large and the large that I ordered him fit perfectly. He wears it more than often!!!
258,This scarf left a lot of lint on my other clothes. It sheds really bad. I am scared I will be left with no scarf at this rate. I guess you get what you pay for. 
259,"I followed all the washing instructions that came with the scarf and whenI was done, it had tiny holes in it. I could not wear it and I could not return it either. I was so mad stay away "
260,"Scarf sheds more than my grandmas cat Bobby. I am so disappointed. For the price, I expected just a little bit more. It did not all do to waste though, I kept it to decorate the snowman in winter "
261,The picture makes it seem af if this scarf is warm and fluffy. I was surprised when I opened the package; its so thin and not very warm. I would need two of these for Canadian winters. I really wanted to buy only one good quality scarf 
262,The scarf was damaged straight from the package - missing tassels. I sent it back immediately   
263,What is on the picture is not what you get with this scarf. I would have paid more to get a better quality scarf. 
264,"It's not made entirely of vegan friendly material. I read the misleading description and I bought the scarf. I only discovered weeks later that I had been lied to when I read the label. If you care about the environment, do not buy this scarf"
265,The way the model in the picture wore the scarf made it seem like an infinity scarf. I was disappointed when I received the package today to realize that the scarf is not infinify. I don't really like to wrestle with my clothing all the time 
266,The measurements for this scarf are way off. It says 1m by 1m but I doubt that what I am looking right now is the scarf that I ordered. I really wanted to use it as a plane and train blanket but it looks like it's just going to be for my neck. I wish they could refrain from deceptive marketing 
267,"The pink color I received for this scarf is not as lively as the one in the picture. I bought a hat in the hot pink to match it with and I don’t think the pairing will go well. For that reason, I am returning this scarf "
268,The burgundy was not that deep for this scarf. I instead received a bright red which I have now fallen in love with. I wish they could take better pictures that show the real colors for their website. The scarf also sheds - its not too crazy shedding though 
269,I could have bought a better scarf or even two at this price. I am highly disappointed at how cheap looking and cheap feeling this scarf is. It was also caught up in Christmas delivery delays and I received it when I had almost forgotten about it 
270,I really liked these pants and found them flattering. I like the straight leg. I ended up ordering a second pair in blue.
271,"I ordered these pants and found them to run small. I called the store and organized an exchange for a bigger size, which I got in the mail in about a week. Really happy with them!"
272,Didn't like these pants AT ALL! I had a busted inseam within a week. Couldn't return them because they were worn. DO NOT RECOMMEND!! 
273,I liked these pants and have worn them a lot since I got them. I found that they look a little stretched but they look fine once I put them in the dryer.
274,I wanted a nice pair of pants that I could wear to the office and on the weekend. I ended up ordering two more pairs and now they are all theat I wear. Great pants!
275,My wife gifted me these pant because she complains I dress to plain. LOL. I like the style but they are not the most comfortable. I find the lining can be itchy. 
276,I hate these pants. I returned them right away. The website describes them as a straight leg but they are cropped too short. I am average height but I found they ended several inches above my ankle. Sigh.
277,I love the pockets of these pants! I find it hard to find women's pants that are flattering and functional. I love how they gather at the bottom without being too restrictive.
278,"I ordered these pants to replace another pair I had from this company, which I had ruined by a paint spill. I like the cut of these pants, and I like how they look"
279,I got these pants within 3 days of ordering then. I love the embelishes and the cut of the leg. Really cute! Wish that they were a little more high-cut. They are awkwardly between mid- and high-rise.
280,Nice pants. These are totally comfortable and are a good sturdy denim. Only wish that the pockets were big enough to hold my phone.
281,"I ordered these pants in my size but find the fit weird. The ankles and legs fit fine, but there is extra material around the waist and it is not flattering at all. It’s as if the wasit fits a size too large, and the rest of the pants are just right. I would advise people to size down. You should be fine because the material is stretchy. "
282,"I cannot believe how cheap these pants are. I ordered these in the dark wash and after trying them on noticed the seams look stretched, with the white of the seams really showing where the denim's dye didn't take. Cute, but I expected a lot more for the price."
283,I love love LOVE the red stitching on these pants. Very trendy. Order came in two weeks after it said it would. Not impressed.
284,"I bought a pair of the pants for each of my three sons. By the looks of how well they are holding up to their roughhousing, I think the youngest will be wearing these pants from hand-me-downs for the rest of his life! Lol!"
285,"I ordered a Large but returned them for a medium. I found the fit of the pants to be really good for an athletic figure and was happy to size down. Customer service was great, and I got the new pair within a week or so.  "
286,"I thought that these pants wouldn't need a built because of the built-in tie, but it is just decoratve. I still have to wear a belt, which looks a little weird with the tie. I really like the deep pockets. They're surprisingly lightweight and very breathable. The material sort of feels like nylon but a little cheaper and thinner."
287,I wanted to get these pants in time for a music festival but they didn’t come in time :( I ordered them 6 weeks in advance but did not get them in time. Great pants though.
288,"Not bad, but the pants stretch pretty easily. After a few washes the hem on the left leg opening opened up a bit. I stitched it up and you can’t tell."
289,"I bought these pants in a M for my sister but they were too big, and actually ended up fitting me (L). I think the embroidery on the pockets is super cute, and I love the raw edge on the bottom. They were delivered quicker than I expected, which was awesome!"
290,"I love the graphics on this shirt, so I bought one for myself and my best friend for her birthday. The material is pretty thin but what do you expect for something so cheap. Really cute!"
291,"I think this shirt is super cute and casual, and goes with practically everything I own lol. The sleves are really long but I just roll them up once or twice and it looks cute."
292,"I am not that tall (5'6"") but for some reason this shirt looks like a crop top on me. Expect to size up or find another shirt. "
293,I liked this shirt and find it true to size. I ordered it in two different colours but I got it delivered in two separate packages. Wasn't happy having to go to the post office twice!
294,I think this shirt looks really good on its own but I also wear it to work under a blazer or with a cardigan and matching scarf. I get questions about it almost every time I wear it! Super happy with how it's held up to frequent use given how inexpensive it is.
295,I love how this shirt fits but the material is very sensitive. There were several small threads I had to snip when I got it but no worries. I find it stains REALLY easily so I have had to soak it a few times to get any drops or spills out. Wish it was a little more durable.
296,"I love how vibrant the green is in this shirt. I am a redhead so the pattern really pops! I am a little heavy set so I sized up to be cautious, which was the right call. I am debating getting it in the other two patterns as well!"
297,"This shirt is really flowy, which I like, but if you don't like that you should size down. I originally bought it to wear casually with jeans but I find if I pair it with some nice jewellery I can get away with wearing it to work. I've been using special laundry detergent and haven't notice the color fading at all, score!"
298,This is a great work out shirt. I bought it originally for running but noticed it's really stretchy and wear it for yoga too. It’s super cute and I will often wear it to and from the gym.
299,"This is the WORST work out shirt. Was this even tested? At all? The description says it can be used for yoga and training but the seams of the shoulders couldn't even hold up to warrior. Horrible quality. Glad I didn't spend a lot on it, not bothering fighting with Returns."
300,This is a fine shirt. Does it's job. I ordered three to wear under my dress shirts at work and I find it keeps me cool and doesn't hold onto sweat stains.
